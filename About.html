            <td>Company About ,  Merkel is an Airbnb company founded by Mervine Odhiambo. I joined the industry with the ideology that I could re-define what Airbnb hosting in Kenya should be. The idea of constantly having to look for websites and agents to help them get these Airbnb but there’s always uncertainty and the client usually either feels that their funds or life are bring threatened. What we aspire to do as a company is not only create a simple, safe and secure way of providing clients with up-to-date modern units in order to meet client satisfaction and centralize the system . The thing  I did in order to set up the first bit of the company are the following:
        •	I formed connections with the hosts around the country and then began narrowing them down to places of interest and even interior areas in Kenya.
        •	I was able to get many reviews for clients whom were either new or friends and family and this proved to be helpful as word went around about us.
        •	Due to lack of funds marketing was majorly done by word of mouth and friend to friend referrals.
        •	The social media platform for the business wasn’t  doing as good as it was meant to but it got the job done.
        •	The funds earned were majorly used in the growth of the business such as getting a new camera system to photograph the units that we were called to call upon.</td>
